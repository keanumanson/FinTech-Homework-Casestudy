# FinTech Case Study: Zip Co Ltd

## Overview and Origin
Zip Co was founded in 2013, by Peter Gray and Larry Diamond, originally naming the company ZipMoney.

Larry Diamond was the main founder, and was keen to get into space as his brother was in e-commerce. After hiring/partnering with Peter Gray and having regular meetings at the pub they talked about how the current interest free loans from GE finance at major retail stores were defective and inefficient. 

*“The processes were clunky and it was predicated on the old credit card,” says Diamond. “We realized we couldn’t compete with the banks. We had to find an unfair advantage. And the way to do that is partnering with retailers. It’s a win-win: they get a customer, the customer gets to spread the payment over time, and we also get the customer.”*

They then continued to work on their idea and expand on it, until eventually they launched their IPO on September 21st in 2015, raising $5m. Zip Co then proceeded to have 4 Post-IPO Equity and 4 Post-IPO Debt funding rounds, from 2015-2021. In total  raising $893.6M over the 8 rounds, with their 3 leading investors being National Australia Bank (NAB), Westpac and Victory Park Capital.

## Business Activities:

* The financial problem Zip Co solves:

Zip Co fixes the issue of customers having to worry about saving, or going into interest based debt in order to purchase things. It lessens any financial short term restrictions customers may have.

They also aim to help tackle the credit card issues, surrounding debts and repayments. [Zip](https://zip.co/investors/senate-select-committee-on-financial-technology-and-regulatory-technology) stated that, *'In fact, only one in 100 Zip customers are late in any given month, compared with one in six for credit card customers that struggle with repayments.'*

Zip creates a lending system, becoming a flexible solution. It allows customers to buy a product now (online and instore) and pay it back later in a series of smaller regular payments. It helps consumers purchase items even if they currently don't have the money. They then pay it back over time allowing customers to buy things they wouldn't currently be able to afford. 

This not only benefits the customers but also retailers/merchants, as it boosts sales by attracting and encouraging purchases from customers who wouldn't have been able to make bigger purchases upfront. 

*'ZipPay is a good bet for those customers who will need more time to gather up the money for their purchases.'* - Nigel Ewart, Digital Outlook.

* Who is the Zip Co's intended customer?

Zip has two intended customers, the retail customer and the retailer or merchant. Due to it being a payment/lending product, it facilitates the transaction between the two parties. 

Zip has over 2 million customers in Australia and New Zealand. 

The consumer retail market:

In 2020, the Annual retail turnover in Australia was 349.9 billion dollars. 
Zip's revenue was $397.1m in 2021 and 157.7 in 2020. 

Furthermore according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/retail-sales-annual#:~:text=Retail%20Sales%20YoY%20in%20Australia,percent%20in%20April%20of%202020.)
*'Retail Sales YoY in Australia averaged 5.71 percent from 1983 until 2021, reaching an all time high of 25 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -9.10 percent in April of 2020.'*
This shows the constant growth within Zips target market. Covid did affect consumer spending only for it to bounce back harder in 2021, following various government and economic changes. 

* The solution they offer that their competitors do not offer?

Zip is a interest free lending provider with *'3 months (interest free) across all products and up to 36 months with some retailers'*. Unlike most credit cards who are mainly only interest free as long as you meet the monthly payments. 
For example according to [Digital Outlook](https://www.digitaloutlook.com.au/need-know-lay-buy-services-afterpay-vs-zippay/#:~:text=ZipPay%20gives%20customers%20a%20credit,ranging%20from%20weekly%20to%20monthly.) *'ZipPay gives customers a credit line of up to $1,000 dollars. Unlike AfterPay, ZipPay.'* This gives the customers a much longer time period to pay back the money they borrowed. ZipPay also has a set minimum monthly repayment of $40. 

ZipPay's main and biggest competitor is AfterPay, another very similar lay-buy service.
One of ZipPay's competitive advantages over AfterPay is that they cost less for the retailer.  
***Please Refer to 'IMAGE2'*** *(attached)*
ZipPay offers half the transaction fees, quicker merchant payment processing time and charges 30-50% less in commissions. 

However, Afterpay is more popular (and has a much higher valuation). After Pay as the company has various other advantages to their system, making it is quite a competitive environment between the two. 



* Which technologies is Zip Co currently using, and how are they implementing them?

Not much information has been released regarding the subject of the underlying technologies and implementation. 
However Zip Co did recently announce that they split the previous combined roles for technology oversight to create the new roles of Chief Technology Officer and Product Officer. 
A Zip Co spokesperson said to iTnews that the Australian CTO role *“will be critical to Zip achieving our mission”.*
*“It is all about Zip scaling rapidly,"*

Zip did suggest that they are using and developing lots of new technologies and implementing them in various ways. One of their spokesperson said, *"As we develop new products and services and go into new geographies, technology continues to play a super critical role."*

## Financial Industry Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry do they operate in?
Zip Co is categorized under the Lending domain, with its services falling in the buy now pay later business model. 


* The major trends and innovations in Fintech Lending over the last 5-10 years:

The major trend (as mentioned earlier), was increased consumer and retail based spending. Yet Australian national credit card debt fell to its lowest level in over 17 years, showing that people are moving away from credit cards, paying off their debts and possibly moving to BNPL (Buy now pay later) interest free lending solutions such as Zip. *'Retail payments data released by the Reserve Bank of Australia shows debt accruing interest on personal credit cards is down $9.31 billion from March 2020 to September 2021, to a total of just $17.68 billion – the lowest level since November 2003.'*
*“Australians have paid down more than $9 billion in credit card debt since COVID-19 hit, a drop of over one third,”* stated Sally Tindall, RateCity.com.au research director.
Yet even with these record low statistics Zip showed a record transaction volume (TTV) of *$2,320.6m, up 141% YoY (annualising at $7.5b+ as at Dec- 2020). Record revenue of $160.0m, up 130% YoY (annualising at $480m+ as at Dec-20)*

On top of that according to a February 2020 investors review by Zip, approximately 70% of Zip’s transaction volume is generated through online ecommerce or either through their app, (this would have only increased during and after the March 2020 Lockdown).
This is because Zip is popular with online merchants as their lending services bring new customer traffic and purchases. 

Afterpay was founded in 2014 (shortly after Zip), with AfterPay's user base and market cap being considerably larger than that of Zip, as they are the main competitor and innovator in the space. 

* The major companies in this domain:

After Pay is Zip Co's immediate and biggest competitor as they offer almost identical  services. After Pay however is reasonably bigger and more successful with a larger customer base, and larger market cap valuation.
Another potentially big BNPL (buy now pay later) is PayPals recent move into the space with their product, PayPal Pay in 4. This offers a similar service to that of After Pay and Zip with some slight variations. PayPal's market cap is 9x bigger than Afterpay and 116 times bigger than Zip. Keep in mind that paypal's main valuation comes from their influence as a payment provider, not lending/BNPL services. PayPal has only recently moved into the Australian Lending space so they haven't gained as much momentum yet.

Some other major companies are the Big 4 banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and National Australia Bank (NAB). All of which have credit card plans and services competing with significant market share within the consumer lending industry.  


## Results

* What has been the business impact of Zip Co so far?
Zip has impacted other businesses by increasing the potential sales from customers. ZipPay increases sales by allowing customers to spend ahead, it also has affected online purchases as many online businesses have also benefited from BNPL services. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? And how does Zip compare, based on these metrics?
The main key metrics to compare lending buy now pay later services would be:

Users/adoption - This is important as it shows and represents the usable success of the product and the popularity it holds in the eyes of their customers. Adoption is one of the biggest goals for any fintech company, so users are the best way to measure that adoption.
Zip Co has an estimated 9.9 million active users globally, whereis their main competitor After Pay has an astounding 16.2 million global users. 

Revenue - Shows how much commissions and income they are generating.
Zip Co's revenue was 102.1 million 2020 (yet 397.1 in 2021), and After Pay's was 519.2 million 2020 (a big difference)

Profitability - This shows how successful their business model is, keeping in mind this metric can be distorted when a company makes large capital intensive purchases or acquisitions, which could benefit the company in the long run.
However both Zip Co and Afterpay are both currently unprofitable, usually almost always reporting net losses.
News.com said in an article that *The Australian market is saturated with BNPL providers with 12 listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, the most anywhere in the world.* As BNPL companies try to gain a competitive advantage and market share through undercutting their commissions and prices or through acquisitions it lowers the overall profitable opportunities in the space.

Market cap - This represents the stock markets view and valuation of the company. Many fintech based companies rely on investments for their foundation, development and expansion. Often companies like Zip Co (which held its last funding round in 2021) hold many funding rounds, and their market cap represents their value within the space, and can be used as a metric for their success. 
Zip Co raised $893.6M over the 8 rounds, with a market cap of 1.55B, and After Pay has had a total of 3 funding rounds raising $448.7 million, with a market cap of 19.97B. 

Overall comparing Zip Co to After Pay clearly shows where ZIP Co stands within the industry. Afterpay makes such a good comparison because the two companies have nearly all products that are the biggest competitors.
Zip Co is not the market leader and is quite far behind After Pay in the metrics discussed.
Zip Co has gone on a spree of acquisitions recently, and has been focusing on their growth and development as a company to even include rebranding their logo, this all could benefit the company in the long run, already increased revenue year on year as shown above. It is most likely that their low profitability draws from their recent expansion. Their user count, although not the highest, is still insanely strong. Market cap and share price has plument recently which is assumed to be a market reacting to their late earnings/profitability report.
*Zip (ASX:Z1P) CEO: ‘We’d be very, very profitable, but we’re reinvesting for growth’*
With The Motley Fool commenting *'Perhaps this sluggish share price performance can be blamed on Zip’s lack of profitability.'*



## Recommendations:

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

A strong  or consideration for Zip Co would be for them to do research and development in the crypto and blockchain space. To potentially adopt and integrate, currently blockchain has many drawbacks, with gas fees etc. It is highly secure making it a good unhackable decentralized route for a lending and payment system such as Zip Co to pursue.
It also helps them to continue to remain competitive in the space, they could even set up some sort of lending system, where a investor could deposit funds which are then used in the BNPL and issued out to customers and the return on that loan that Zip makes could be returned to the investor for providing the liquidity to facilitate the loa. This also lowers the risk that Zip takes on everytime a customer makes a loan based purchase, passing it onto the other investor in exchange for a reward. using decentralized databases and transactional services through the blockchain not only could reduce server and maintenance costs but increase the integrity and security of the transactions, customer information and IDs.
