# FinTech Case Study: Zip Co Ltd

## Overview and Origin
Zip Co was founded in 2013, by Peter Gray and Larry Diamond, originally naming the company ZipMoney.

Larry Diamond was the main founder, and was keen to get into space as his brother was in e-commerce. After hiring/partnering with Peter Gray and having regular meetings at the pub they talked about how the current interest free loans from GE finance at major retail stores were defective and inefficient. 

*“The processes were clunky and it was predicated on the old credit card,” says Diamond. “We realized we couldn’t compete with the banks. We had to find an unfair advantage. And the way to do that is partnering with retailers. It’s a win-win: they get a customer, the customer gets to spread the payment over time, and we also get the customer.”*

They then continued to work on their idea and expand on it, until eventually they launched their IPO on September 21st in 2015, raising $5m. Zip Co then proceeded to have 4 Post-IPO Equity and 4 Post-IPO Debt funding rounds, from 2015-2021. In total  raising $893.6M over the 8 rounds, with their 3 leading investors being National Australia Bank (NAB), Westpac and Victory Park Capital.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Zip Co fixes the issue of customers having to worry about saving, or going into interest based debt in order to purchase things. It lessens any financial short term restrictions customers may have.

They also aim to help tackle the credit card issues, surrounding debts and repayments. [Zip](https://zip.co/investors/senate-select-committee-on-financial-technology-and-regulatory-technology) stated that, *'In fact, only one in 100 Zip customers are late in any given month, compared with one in six for credit card customers that struggle with repayments.'*

Zip creates a lending system, becoming a flexible solution. It allows customers to buy a product now (online and instore) and pay it back later in a series of smaller regular payments. It helps consumers purchase items even if they currently don't have the money. They then pay it back over time allowing customers to buy things they wouldn't currently be able to afford. 

This not only benefits the customers but also retailers/merchants, as it boosts sales by attracting and encouraging purchases from customers who wouldn't have been able to make bigger purchases upfront. 

*'ZipPay is a good bet for those customers who will need more time to gather up the money for their purchases.'* - Nigel Ewart, Digital Outlook.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Zip has two intended customers, the retail customer and the retailer or merchant. Due to it being a payment/lending product, it facilitates the transaction between two the parties. 

Zip has over 2 million customers in Australia and New Zealand. 

The consumer retail market:

In 2020, the Annual retail turnover in Australia was 349.9 billion dollars. 
Zip's revenue was $397.1m in 2021 and 157.7 in 2020. 

Furthermore according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/retail-sales-annual#:~:text=Retail%20Sales%20YoY%20in%20Australia,percent%20in%20April%20of%202020.)
*'Retail Sales YoY in Australia averaged 5.71 percent from 1983 until 2021, reaching an all time high of 25 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -9.10 percent in April of 2020.'*
This shows the constant growth within Zips target market. Covid did affect consumer spending only for it to bounce back harder in 2021, following various government and economic changes. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Zip is a interest free lending provider with *'3 months (interest free) across all products and up to 36 months with some retailers'*. Unlike most credit cards who are mainly only interest free as long as you meet the monthly payments. 
For example according to [Digital Outlook](https://www.digitaloutlook.com.au/need-know-lay-buy-services-afterpay-vs-zippay/#:~:text=ZipPay%20gives%20customers%20a%20credit,ranging%20from%20weekly%20to%20monthly.) *'ZipPay gives customers a credit line of up to $1,000 dollars. Unlike AfterPay, ZipPay.'* This gives the customers a much longer time period to pay back the money they borrowed. ZipPay also has a set minimum monthly repayment of $40. 

ZipPay's main and biggest competitor is AfterPay, another very similar lay-buy service.
One of ZipPay's competitive advantages over AfterPay is that they cost less for the retailer.  
***Please Refer to 'IMAGE2'*** *(attached)*
ZipPay offers half the transaction fees, quicker merchant payment processing time and charges 30-50% less in commissions. 

However Afterpay is more popular (and has a much higher valuation), as the company has various other advantages to their system.



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Not much information has been released regarding the subject of the underlying technologies and implementation. 
However Zip Co did recently announce that they split the previous combined roles for technology oversight to create the new roles of Chief Technology Officer and Product Officer. 
A Zip Co spokesperson said to iTnews that the Australian CTO role *“will be critical to Zip achieving our mission”.*
*“It is all about Zip scaling rapidly,"*

Zip did suggest that they are using and developing lots of new technologies and implementing them in various ways. One of their spokesperson said, *"As we develop new products and services and go into new geographies, technology continues to play a super critical role."*

## Financial Industry Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Zip Co is categorized under the Lending domain, with its services falling in the buy now pay later business model. 


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The major trend (as mentioned earlier), was increased consumer and retail based spending. Yet Australian national credit card debt fell to its lowest level in over 17 years, showing that people are moving away from credit cards, paying off their debts and possibly moving to BNPL (Buy now pay later) interest free lending solutions such as Zip. *'Retail payments data released by the Reserve Bank of Australia shows debt accruing interest on personal credit cards is down $9.31 billion from March 2020 to September 2021, to a total of just $17.68 billion – the lowest level since November 2003.'*
*“Australians have paid down more than $9 billion in credit card debt since COVID-19 hit, a drop of over one third,”* stated Sally Tindall, RateCity.com.au research director.
Yet even with these record low statistics Zip showed a record transaction volume (TTV) of *$2,320.6m, up 141% YoY (annualising at $7.5b+ as at Dec- 2020). Record revenue of $160.0m, up 130% YoY (annualising at $480m+ as at Dec-20)*

On top of that according to a February 2020 investors review by Zip, approximately 70% of Zip’s transaction volume is generated through online ecommerce or either through their app, (this would have only increased during and after the March 2020 Lockdown).
This is because Zip is popular with online merchants as their lending services bring new customer traffic and purchases. 

Afterpay was founded in 2014 (shortly after Zip), with AfterPay's user base and market cap being considerably larger than that of Zip, as they are the main competitor and innovator in the space. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
After Pay is Zip Co's immediate and biggest competitor as they offer almost identical  services. After Pay however is reasonably bigger and more sucsessfull with a larger customer base, and larger market cap valuation. 

Some other major companies within the lending domain are the Big 4 banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, and National Australia Bank. All of which have credit card plans and services competing within the consumer lending industry.
