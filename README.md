# FinTech Case Study: Zip Co Ltd

## Overview and Origin
Zip Co was founded in 2013, by Peter Gray and Larry Diamond, originally naming the company Zip Money.

Larry Diamond was the main founder, and was keen to get into space as his brother was in e-commerce. After hiring/partnering with Peter Gray and having regular meetings at the pub they talked about how the current interest free loans from GE finance at major retail stores defective and inefficient. 

*“The processes were clunky and it was predicated on the old credit card,” says Diamond. “We realised we couldn’t compete with the banks. We had to find an unfair advantage. And the way to do that is partnering with retailers. It’s a win-win: they get a customer, the customer gets to spread the payment over time, and we also get the customer.”*

They then continued to work on their idea and expand on it, until eventually they launched their IPO on September 21st in 2015, raising $5m. Zip Co then preceeded to have 4 Post-IPO Equity and 4 Post-IPO Debt funding rounds, from 2015-2021. In total  raising $893.6M over the 8 rounds, wiht their 3 leading investors being National Australia Bank (NAB), Westpac and Victory Park Capital.

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Zip Co fixes the issue of customers having to worry about saving, or going into interest based debt in order to purchase things. It lessens any financial short term restictions customers may have.
Zip creates a lending system, becoming a flexible solution. It allows customers to buy a product now (online and instore) and pay it back later in a series of smaller regular payments. It helps consumers purhcase items even if they currently don't have the money. They then paying it back over time it allowing customers to buy things they wouldn't currently be able to afford. 

This not only benefits the customers but also retailers/merchants, as it boosts sales by attracting and enchouraging purchases from customers who wouldn't have been able to make bigger purchases upfront.
